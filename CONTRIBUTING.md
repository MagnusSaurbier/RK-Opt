Contributions to RK-Opt are most welcome!  If you have an idea for a new
feature, or simply see something that should be fixed/improved, you can:

  - [Raise an issue to let us know](https://github.com/ketch/RK-Opt/issues)
  - Better yet, fork the RK-Opt repository on Github, implement the change
    yourself, and [open a pull request](https://github.com/ketch/RK-Opt/pulls)

Ideally, contributions that include new functionality should also include
documentation and testing, but we can help with that part as needed.

If you're raising an issue to report a bug, please provide enough detail to
let us reproduce the bug.
